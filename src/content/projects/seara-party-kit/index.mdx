### Intro
The Seara Party Kit is the way Seara created to give gifts to those we care about most and who are essential in our daily lives. They are frozen Christmas baskets with an exclusive collection of beautiful printed thermal bags with a unique design.

The Seara Party Kit has consistently won awards such as “Management & HR” and has been ranked among the “100 Best Suppliers” since 2014.

### About the Project
The Seara Party Kit website was entirely redesigned by the FRN³ team to match the nowadays modern standards.

Because Seara's logistics and business logic a special solution in the checkout module was needed, so a custom architecture based in VTEX IO middleware services was created to solve those issues.

The website was released at the beginning of the 2024 second semester and is ready for the Christmas operations.
