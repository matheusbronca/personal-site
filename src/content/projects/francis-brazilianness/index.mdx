### About the Project

Francis is a Brazilian brand of skincare products, whose mission is to elevate the lives of Brazilians through perfume. Pioneer in the manufacture of soaps with high perfume power, Francis uses its potential to create the best fragrances, inspiring everyone around it.

Composed of eight soaps, "Brazilianness" aka. "Brasilidades" is a new Francis fragrance line up, with a tropical touch by featuring olfactory essences common in Brazil, such as: Coconut Water, Lemongrass, Starfruit, Pink Mango, Graviola, Acerola, Blackberry and Sweet Lime.

To present the new line up in Francis online store, a customized category shelf page was built. The page counted with fluid animations powered by GSAP library and an unique slider to help customers find their favorite fragrance.

The page is part of a CRM strategy powered by FRN³ team, that had increased the e-commerce sales in 830%, with incredible spikes of 1.300% in some campaigns.

### Assignment
Develop and implement the entire solution, following the UI already designed in Figma by the FRN³ UI/UX team.

### Technical notes
  Francis e-commerce is powered by nuvemshop an e-commerce platform based in the PHP language. We had to use <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Twig</a>, a PHP template engine, to develop all the server-side components and added all the interactive behavior in the client-side. That was our first experience with Twig, a bit challenging but definitely rewarding.
